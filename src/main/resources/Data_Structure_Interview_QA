Asked Interview QA
1. What will happen if you declare size of ArrayList as 10 and you insert 11 element in it?
    When you declare the size of an ArrayList as 10 and insert the 11th element, the ArrayList will automatically resize
    itself to accommodate the additional element.

    How It Works Internally:
    1. Initial Capacity:
       When you create an ArrayList with a capacity of 10, the internal array used by the ArrayList is initialized to hold
       up to 10 elements.

    2. Insertion of 11th Element:
       When you attempt to add the 11th element, the ArrayList detects that its current capacity is insufficient.
       It will:
        * Create a new array with a larger capacity (typically 1.5 times the current capacity, depending on the implementation).
        * Copy the existing elements to the new array.
        * Add the 11th element to the new array.

    3. Result:
    The 11th element is successfully added, and the internal array now has a larger capacity to accommodate more
    elements in the future.

    example:
    public class ArrayListExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(10);

            // Add 11 elements
            for (int i = 1; i <= 11; i++) {
                list.add(i);
            }

            System.out.println("ArrayList: " + list);
            System.out.println("Size: " + list.size());
        }
    }

    output:

    ArrayList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    Size: 11
