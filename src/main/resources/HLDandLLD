High-Level Design (HLD) Questions

1. Design an E-commerce System ? How would you design an e-commerce application like Amazon or Flipkart?
    Focus Areas:
        Components like product catalog, cart, order management, payment, and delivery.
        Scalability for handling high traffic.
        Database design for storing user and product data.
        Integration with third-party payment systems.

        1. Components:
           User Service: Handles user management (sign-up, authentication).
           Product Service: Manages the product catalog, inventory, and pricing.
           Cart Service: Tracks users' shopping carts.
           Order Service: Processes orders, payments, and invoices.
           Payment Gateway: Integrates with third-party payment providers.
           Delivery Service: Tracks shipping and delivery.

        2. Scalability:
           Use load balancers (e.g., NGINX) to distribute traffic.
           Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., products) using Redis.
           Use microservices architecture for modularity and independent scaling.

        3. Database:
           Relational DB for transactions (e.g., MySQL for orders and payments).
           NoSQL DB (e.g., MongoDB) for product catalogs and user activity.

        4. Communication:
           Use REST APIs for service communication for synchronous.
           Add message queues (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous tasks like notifications.

        5. Security:
           Use OAuth2/JWT for authentication.
           Encrypt sensitive data like passwords and payment details.


2. Design a Payment Gateway System ? How would you design a payment gateway system for processing online transactions?
    1. Components:
        Authentication: Verify user credentials securely.
        Transaction Processor: Handles payment initiation and validation.
        Fraud Detection: Detects unusual patterns to prevent fraud.
        Notification System: Notifies users of payment success or failure.

    2. Workflow:
        User submits payment request → Request is validated → API communicates with third-party payment providers
        (e.g., UPI, PayPal) → Updates transaction status.

    3. Scalability:
        Use stateless microservices for transaction handling.
        Enable horizontal scaling for high traffic during sales.
        Cache results of frequent checks (e.g., card validation) using Redis.

    4. Resiliency:
        Use Circuit Breaker Pattern to prevent cascading failures.
        Implement retries for failed transactions.

LLD (Low-Level Design) Questions and Answers:

1. How would you design a payment service class?
Answer:
    Entities:
        Payment: Represents payment details (amount, type).
        Transaction: Tracks payment status (Pending, Success, Failed).
        User: Links payment to a specific user.

2. How would you implement an inventory management system?
    Entities:
        Product: Stores product details (ID, name, price).
        Stock: Tracks inventory quantity.
        Warehouse: Stores warehouse location and stock.


Scenario-Based Questions
1. How do you scale an application to handle 1 million concurrent users?
Answer:
    * Use load balancers (NGINX or Azure Load Balancer).
    * Enable horizontal scaling for backend microservices using Kubernetes (AKS).
    * Cache frequently accessed data with Redis.
    * Use event-driven architecture with Kafka for asynchronous tasks.

2. How do you ensure fault tolerance in a payment service?
Answer:
    * Use Circuit Breaker Pattern to handle downstream failures.
    * Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
    * Use replicated databases across multiple availability zones for high availability.
